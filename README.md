# RShiny_NZTides

I created this simpe R Shiny app to help me plan my bird photography trips based on tides and sunrise/sunset times.  

It plots tide charts for New Zealand ports, and the sunrise and sunset times with an approximation of the golden hours.

You can also run this app from [here](https://bluepanda.shinyapps.io/nztides/)
